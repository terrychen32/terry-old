# Personal Portfolio Project

## Getting Started

This website has taken inspiration and design from Britanny Chiang ([here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)) and Andres Jose ([here]https://github.com/andresjosehr)

This project is really meant to help me better understand Angular and web development fundamentals in a way that is relevant and fun. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm and Angular CLI installed in your pc. Npm is aviable with NodeJS in [here](https://nodejs.org/es/). After you install npm, install Angular CLI by typping the following command in your terminal

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Just clone  the repo and excecute the following command inside the folder proyect

``` bash
npm install
```

### All done!!

Now just run
```
npm start
```
Wait to compile and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) after compile finish

### Wait! I does not have finished yet!

I want to quote what Brittanty has added in her proyect:

>## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

>Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.
I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

As I have made an attribution to Brittany, i wait you do the same with both in this proyect. Thank you :)

Sorry my bad English
