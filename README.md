# Personal Portfolio Project

## Getting Started

This website has taken inspiration and design from Britanny Chiang ([here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)) and Andres Jose ([here](https://github.com/andresjosehr)).

This project is really meant to help me better understand Angular and web development fundamentals in a way that is relevant and fun. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm and Angular CLI installed in your pc. Npm is aviable with NodeJS in [here](https://nodejs.org/es/). After you install npm, install Angular CLI by typping the following command in your terminal

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Just clone  the repo and excecute the following command inside the folder project

``` bash
npm install
```

### All done!!

Now just run
```
npm start
```
Wait to compile and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) after compile finish
